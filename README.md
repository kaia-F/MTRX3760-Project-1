## Project Overview 📜
This repository is developed as part of MTRX3760 Project 1 at the University of Sydney.\
The project simulates a TurtleBot 3 robot navigating through two distinct maze environments, including an open maze and a closed maze, within RViz and Gazebo.\
When launched, the TurtleBot autonomously explores the maze using a right wall following navigation logic. Its goal is to reach the maze exit, visually marked by a green square box, while using simulated LiDAR and camera sensors for perception of surroundings.

## File Descriptions

### Source files overview (turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/src)
- **turtlebot3_drive.cpp** — ROS 2 executable node that wires up publishers/subscribers (Lidar, cmd_vel, odom) and runs the main control loop for driving.
- **wall_follower_state_machine.cpp** — Right/left-wall following finite-state machine (follow/turn/realign, gap/corner handling).
- **turtlebot3_pose_trajectory.cpp** - Records the robot’s poses over time from /odom and publishes it on trajectory_marker to visualize the robot’s path in RViz.
- **turtlebot3_camera.cpp** - Processes the simulated camera stream to detect a green goal region, publishes a boolean stop signal, and exposes the latest frames.
### Headers files overview (turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/include/turtlebot3_gazebo)
- **turtlebot3_drive.hpp** — Declares the Turtlebot3Drive class (ROS 2 node interface): publishers/subscribers, parameter loading, and main control callbacks.
- **wall_follower_state_machine.hpp** — State machine for wall-following navigation, reads sensor readings and robot state as input and returns velocity commands.
- **wall_follower_config.hpp** — Parameter struct for wall-following behavior (target distance, PID gains, speed limits) to read from tuning parameters to eliminate magic numbers.
- **utilities.hpp** — small helper functions (normalise angle) across components.
- **sensor_data.hpp** — Encapsulates LIDAR sensor readings from three directions; helpers to derive obstacles, gaps, and wall distance from raw topics
- **robot_state.hpp**- Tracks the robott class of the robot’s current state (position, orientation and yaw).
- **turtlebot3_camera.hpp** - Declares the CameraNode ROS 2 node interface that subscribes to camera images, performs green-goal detection and publishes a Bool stop signal
- **turtlebot3_pose_trajectory.hpp** - Declares the PoseTrajectory ROS 2 node that subscribes to odometry, accumulates positions into a LINE_STRIP marker, and publishes the robot’s path for visualization.
### Launch files overview (turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch)
- **openmaze.launch.py** — Spawns TurtleBot3 in the open maze world and starts the core nodes (Gazebo sim, robot_state_publisher, and drive node) for the wall-following logic in a designed open maze layout.
- **closedmaze.launch.py** — Spawns TurtleBot3 in the closed maze world and brings up the same core stack in previous open maze.
- **turtlebot3_dqn_stage1_custom.launch.py** — Fast-start launch for testing robot logic; loads the robot inside a square map and run the drive node to test parameters.

## Requirements
### Software Requirements
- **OS:**
  - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble), amd64 or arm64.
- **ROS 2 distribution:**
  - ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco (desktop or ros-base profile). Install from deb packages on Ubuntu 24.04. RViz2 is included inside.
- **Gazebo Ignition:**
  - Gazebo Sim “Harmonic” (current recommended Gazebo for ROS 2). On Jazzy, Gazebo is provided via ROS vendor packages.
- **TurtleBot3 Simulation**
-   turtlebot3_gazebo, turtlebot3_msgs, turtlebot3_description packages for Jazzy.



### Installation & Setup ⚙️

### 1. TurtleBot3 PC Setup  
Follow the **PC Setup** steps from the official TurtleBot3 Quick Start Guide (Jazzy version):  
🔗 [TurtleBot3 Quick Start – PC Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup)

This includes:
- Installing **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco** on Ubuntu 24.04.
- Setting up TurtleBot3 packages (`turtlebot3`, `turtlebot3_msgs`, `turtlebot3_gazebo`).
- Configuring the TurtleBot3 model environment variable (`burger`, `waffle`, or `waffle_pi`).

---

### 2. Launching Gazebo (Ignition / Gazebo Sim)
This simulation requires **ROS 2 Jazzy** and **Gazebo (Ignition/Harmonic)**.

#### **Terminal 1 — Start the Gazebo Simulation**

**Kill any leftover Gazebo processes:**
```bash
pkill -9 -f gazebo
pkill -9 -f gzserver
pkill -9 -f gzclient
```
**Set TurtleBot3 model:**
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
```
**Go to workspace:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/MTRX3760-Project-1/turtlebot3_ws
```
**Build only turtlebot3_gazebo with override (in case of underlay conflict):**
```bash
colcon build --packages-select turtlebot3_gazebo --allow-overriding turtlebot3_gazebo
```
**Source workspace:**
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
**Launch Gazebo with your custom launch file:**
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_dqn_stage1_custom.launch.py
```
**Terminal 2: Build and run the modified code  **\
**Go to workspace**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/MTRX3760-Project-1/turtlebot3_ws
```
Run the drive node:
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_drive
```



## Testing and Troubleshooting 🧪
### Turtlebot robot setup testing
Confirm packages are built and discoverable
```bash
ros2 pkg prefix turtlebot3_description
ros2 pkg prefix turtlebot3_gazebo
ros2 pkg prefix turtlebot3_msgs
```
Check if robot has spawned:  \
In a new terminal, check for topics including /cmd_vel, /scan, /odom, /tf to confirm the robot is publishing control ready.
```bash
ros2 node list | grep -E 'gazebo|spawn|robot_state_publisher'
ros2 topic list | grep -E '/cmd_vel|/scan|/odom|/tf'
```
Publish a test velocity to make the robot roll forward for 3 seconds:
```bash
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.2}, angular: {z: 0.0}}' --qos-durability transient_local
```
Or manually control the robot with teleop:  \
In a new terminal, run ros2 teleop
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger_cam
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
```

### Maze Testing

This section explains how to run, observe, and assess the robot’s behaviour in the Open/Closed mazes and test custom world.

```bash
# From workspace root
colcon build --packages-select turtlebot3_gazebo
source install/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger_cam

# Open maze
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo openmaze.launch.py

# Closed maze 
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo closedmaze.launch.py

# Custom developer test 
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo custom_test.launch.py
```

**What to watch (topics & visuals)**
- **Path trace**: /trajectory_marker (visualization_msgs/Marker LINE_STRIP) — shows where the robot has been.
- **Velocity commands**: /cmd_vel — steady commands with minimal oscillation indicate a stable controller
- **Odometry**: /odom & /tf — verify pose updates.
- **Goal detection (camera)**: /goal_reached_signal (std_msgs/Bool) — boolean turns true on green-goal.
- **Camera**: camera/image_raw (and GUI in turtlebot3_camera)

**Launch RViz**
```bash
rviz2
# Add: LaserScan(/scan), Odometry(/odom), TF, Marker(/trajectory_marker)
```
**Success criteria**\
Checks to decide if a run passes:
- **OpenMaze/ClosedMaze**: robot follows the right wall and navigates turns without collisions, execute recoveries within 5 seconds, path is smooth, reaches goal or runs continuously with stable /cmd_vel.
- **CustomTest**: parameter changes (e.g., target wall distance) lead to predictable changes in behaviour within 2 secs

**Record and measure**
```bash
# Check basic robot state
ros2 topic hz /scan
ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel

# Record a run for later analysis
ros2 bag record /scan /cmd_vel /odom /trajectory_marker /goal_reached_signal

# Quick inspection
ros2 topic echo /goal_reached_signal
```
